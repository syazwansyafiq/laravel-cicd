# Laravel CI/CD Demonstration

This README provides a guide to setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a Laravel application using GitHub Actions. The setup also includes monitoring and performance metrics with Grafana, Prometheus, Redis, and utilizes Nginx and MySQL for deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Laravel application set up.
- A GitHub repository for your project.
- Basic knowledge of Docker and Docker Compose.
- Docker installed on your local machine.
- Docker images for Grafana, Prometheus, Redis, Nginx, and MySQL.

## Setup GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions will automate the testing and deployment of your Laravel application. 

1. **Create a GitHub Actions Directory**: In your project repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory.

2. **Add a Workflow File**: Within this directory, create a file named `ci-cd.yml`. This file will define the steps for building, testing, and deploying your application.

## Monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus

Monitoring your application involves setting up Grafana and Prometheus to track metrics.

1. **Setup Prometheus and Grafana**: Use Docker Compose to define and run containers for both Prometheus and Grafana. 

2. **Configure Prometheus**: Create a configuration file for Prometheus to specify what metrics it should scrape. 

3. **Access Grafana**: Once Grafana is running, you can access it via a web browser and set up Prometheus as a data source for visualizing metrics.

## Redis Setup

Redis will be used for caching and session management.

1. **Add Redis Service**: Include a Redis container in your Docker Compose setup.

2. **Update Laravel Configuration**: Configure your Laravel application to use Redis for caching, sessions, and queues by updating the `.env` file.

## Nginx Configuration

Nginx will act as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests and pass them to your Laravel application.

1. **Add Nginx Service**: Define an Nginx container in your Docker Compose setup.

2. **Create Nginx Configuration File**: Set up the Nginx configuration to proxy requests to the Laravel application.

## MySQL Database

MySQL will be used as the database for your Laravel application.

1. **Add MySQL Service**: Include a MySQL container in your Docker Compose setup.

2. **Update Laravel Configuration**: Configure your Laravel application to connect to MySQL by updating the `.env` file with database connection details.

## Running the Application

1. **Build and Start Services**: Use Docker Compose to build and start all the services defined in your setup.

2. **Access Application**: Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost` to view your running Laravel application.

3. **Access Prometheus and Grafana**: You can monitor metrics by visiting `http://localhost:9090` for Prometheus and `http://localhost:3000` for Grafana.

You now have a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and a fully integrated environment for monitoring and deploying your Laravel application.
